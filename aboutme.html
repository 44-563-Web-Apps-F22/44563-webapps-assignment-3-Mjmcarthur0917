    <p>My name is Matthew McArthur and I am a senior at NWMSU and am pursuing a bachelors 
        degree in Cyber Security. I am from Lee's Summit, MO. I love to hunt and fish and shoot guns. 
        I currently am apart of the Northwest Fishing team where I participate in tournaments and kayak tournaments. 
        A hobby of mine that I really enjoy is blade smitthing. It is a really relaxing and stress 
        relieving activity that I love.</p>
    <h2>Escape Plan</h2>
    <p>I really like this movie because it has Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger 
        wich are one of my favorite actors and they star in this movie very well.
